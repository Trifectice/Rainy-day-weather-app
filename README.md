# Rainy day Weather API!

## Description

I wanted to build a weather tool calling a free public api in order to test my ability to call API's and display that information while dynamically applying the user's imput into the query! I also wanted to use this project to start working on my UI coding abilities and try something new. now there's an amazing application for anyone to use in order to see the weather in their area!
